# Quizzical

Quizzical is a trivia application built with React, styled-components and the Open Trivia Database API. This was a personal project of mine and an extension of the quizzical solo project from the React basics module in the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

You can view the application live [here](https://benchong.dev/projects/quizzical/) and read more about this project in this [case study](https://benchong.dev/projects/quizzical/) I wrote.
